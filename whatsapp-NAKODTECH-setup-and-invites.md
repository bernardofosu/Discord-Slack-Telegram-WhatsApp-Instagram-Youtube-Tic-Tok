# 📱 WhatsApp Setup — **NAKODTECH DEVSECOPS ACADEMY**

This gives you an admin-ready WhatsApp setup with **invite-only joining**. (WhatsApp doesn’t support true *single-use* links; use **Admin approval + Reset Link** or **Add via contact** for one-person invites.)

---

## 🏗️ Choose your structure
- **Community (recommended for academies):** one **Announcements** group + multiple **sub‑groups** (General, Q&A, Labs…).  
- **Single Group:** simpler, but announcements can get noisy.

> Tip: Use a **Community** named *“NAKODTECH DEVSECOPS ACADEMY”*. Inside it, keep an **Announcements** group (admins only) and create sub‑groups for chat.

---

## 🚀 Create the Community & Groups
**WhatsApp → New Community → Get Started**
1) **Name:** `NAKODTECH DEVSECOPS ACADEMY`  
2) **Icon:** 512×512 logo, **Description:** short mission + rules  
3) **Add Announcement Group** (WhatsApp prompts you)  
4) **Create Sub‑Groups** (inside the community):
   - 💬 **General**
   - 👋 **Introductions**
   - ❓ **Q&A**
   - 🧪 **Labs Help**
   - 📚 **Resources**
   - 🔒 **Staff (private)** *(admins only)*

**Promote co‑admins:** Community → **View Groups** → pick a group → **Group Info → Group Settings → Add Admin** (choose Instructors/TAs).

---

## 🔧 Essential settings (per group)
Open **Group Info → Group Settings** and set:
- **Send Messages:** *Only admins* (for **Announcements** group).  
- **Edit Group Info:** *Only admins*.  
- **Approve New Participants:** **ON** (you must approve joins from links).  
- *(Optional)* **Disappearing Messages:** 7/30 days to keep history clean.  
- *(Optional)* **Restrict Media:** moderate via rules + admin oversight.

> For chat groups (General/Q&A/Labs), allow member messages; keep **Approve New Participants = ON** for invite control.

---

## 🔐 One‑person invite options (free)
### ✅ Best: **Add via contact** (targeted, no shareable link)
- **Group Info → Add Participants → Invite** *(select the person from your contacts)*.  
- Only that phone number gets the invite; others can’t reuse it.

### ✅ Controlled link: **Invite via link** + **Admin approval** + **Reset link**
1) **Group Info → Invite to Group via Link → Invite via Link**.  
2) Tap **Link Settings / (i)** → ensure **Approve New Participants = ON** in Group Settings.  
3) Send the link **privately** to one person.  
4) When they request to join, **Approve** only their number.  
5) After they join, **Reset Link** (same screen) → previous link becomes **invalid**.

> WhatsApp maintains **one** invite link per group. Resetting it invalidates the old link; use this to approximate single‑use. For many students, repeat: **Approve → Reset → Send**.

### 🧾 QR codes (alternative)
- **Invite via Link → QR Code** → show/scan in person. **Reset Link** after use.

---

## 🛡️ Moderation & safety
- **Remove & Report:** long‑press a message → **Delete / Report**; **Group Info → Remove from group** for users.  
- **Only admins can add:** keep **Approve New Participants = ON**; avoid posting the link publicly.  
- **Rules post:** pin a short code of conduct in **Announcements** and reference it in each sub‑group.
